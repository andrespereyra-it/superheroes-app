# React Superheroes App
This is the React Challenge from Alkemy.
It is an app to create a superheroes team with an external API. After login, we could search for superheroes and choose them for our team. Also we will be able to see the differents attributes each member of the team has as well as a series of statistics.

# Technical background
* I use Bootstrap for styling.
* The Login Form and validations for it, were made with Formik library.
* After login, the token is saved in localStorage. Which allow us to keep session.
* The API call was developed with Axios library.
